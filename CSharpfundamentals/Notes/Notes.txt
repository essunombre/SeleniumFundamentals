I am going to test my notes on github

Ok this is going to be for automation

I am using nUnit, I donwloaded the nuGet SeleniumSupport SeleniumWebdriver and WebDriverManager

WHERE TO FIND THE RESULTS?
under Output selecting Tests I can see the execution.

STARTING THE TEST:
I must add the driver new ChromeDriver(); under the SetUp

driver.Close(); //only one window
driver.Quit(); //2windows

But I want to learn more from those 2 methods

Always remember to add the nugets correctly.

LOCATORS:
-Xpath
-Css
-ID
-ClassName
-Name
-TagName
-linkText

CSS SELECTOR
tagname[attribute='value']
ie: input[id='signInBtn']

XPATH
//tagname[@attribute='value']
ie: //input[@id='signInBtn']
